Assignment


Instructions:

Alright so let’s put it all together! Most of us are familiar with Facebook by now but if you are not here is a link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to the main website. Two of the main features of Facebook online person profile creation and photo galleries. Let’s try to create two simple web pages that accomplish the same goal. Start with the following:

 

1. Create a folder on your Desktop named Foundations Project

2. Create three files within this folder named as follows:

profile.html

gallery.html

main.css

 

Each file will represent a different page on your fictitious website. The profile.html will represent your profile page while the gallery.html file will represent your gallery page. On your profile page, try adding the following:

1. A title using an h1

2. A navigation bar with 3 links:

Home -> profile.html

Profile -> profile.html

Gallery -> gallery.html

3. A picture of yourself

4. A unordered list where you identify your:

Birthday

Hobbies

Favorite TV Shows

5. Two short paragraphs describing yourself

6. A footer area with links to social media accounts that you have

Twitter -> twitter profile

Facebook -> facebook profile

 

On your gallery page, try adding the following:

1. A title using an h1

2. A navigation bar with 3 links:

Home -> profile.html

Profile -> profile.html

Gallery -> gallery.html

3. 6 photos arranged in a grid format

4. A footer area with links to social media accounts that you have

Twitter -> twitter profile

Facebook -> facebook profile

One your stylesheet, try doing the following:

1. Have the stylesheet linked to both the profile.html and gallery.html page

2. Style the following elements:

All titles

The navigation bar

The footer

The photos in the gallery page

 

The goal is not to have it be perfect but to have you try out different color combinations, fonts, sizing of text and placement of items on the page. The information on the profile itself does not have to be accurate. So be as creative as possible with the content and the design.
